        <p>Welcome to Link Safe — a powerful, AI-driven moderation solution built for Discord servers. This Privacy Policy outlines how Link Safe (the “Service”) handles your data and what you can expect when using it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Link Safe is developed and maintained by @linksafe (the “Developer”) with the goal of protecting Discord communities from malicious activity. By using the Service, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Data Collection & Storage</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The Service <b>does NOT store any user data</b> unless it is explicitly requested or necessary for functionality.</li>
          <li>No private information is retained passively or without your knowledge.</li>

      <section>
        <h1>Security & Encryption</h1>
        <p>Link Safe enhances server security using **cryptographic measures** such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</b></li>
          <li><b>Fernet encryption:</b> a symmetric-key algorithm that ensures both confidentiality and data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All sensitive data processed by the Service is encrypted and verified before any further handling.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Error Handling</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The Service may post <b>encrypted error logs</b> to a third-party service, [Haste (hst.sh)](https://hst.sh), for debugging purposes.</li>
          <li>These messages are publicly accessible but <b>only the Developer has the decryption keys</b> necessary to read and resolve them.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Responsibility & Liability</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The Developer provides this Service <b>"as is"</b> and makes no guarantees about its behavior or effectiveness in every scenario.</li>
          <li><b>The Developer is not responsible</b> for any direct or indirect damages, data loss, or server issues caused by using the Service.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Changes to this Policy</h1>
